# Task 7  AI Driven Development 30 Day Challenge

## SPECKit Plus  Short Note
**SPECKit Plus** is an AI prompting framework that formalizes collaboration between developers and AI coding agents like Copilot, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI. It uses **Specification Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence (SDD-RI)** to ensure that every feature produces **working code** and **reusable knowledge**, aligning outputs with project standards and improving long term human AI collaboration.

## 5 Core Concepts of SPECKit Plus 

### 1. /constitution
This phase creates a **Constitution file** that defines project wide quality standards and guiding principles. It ensures all future code and specifications adhere to rules like architecture, performance, and accessibility.

### 2. /specify
The **Specify** phase captures a new feature idea as a formal high level specification. It describes what the feature should accomplish from a user perspective, without including technical implementation details.

### 3. /plan
The **Plan** phase transforms the specification into a detailed **technical plan**, including architecture decisions, tools, libraries, and strategy. It outlines how the feature will be built and documents implementation steps.

### 4. /tasks
This phase breaks the technical plan into **atomic tasks** (15 30 min each) with clear acceptance criteria. It ensures tasks are actionable, reviewable, and traceable, and sets up checkpoints for human validation.

### 5. /implement
The **Implement** phase executes tasks with AI collaboration. Each task is completed according to the plan and constitution rules, with human checkpoints validating correctness, standard adherence, and overall progress before moving to the next task.
