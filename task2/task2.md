# AIDD 30-Day Challenge  Task 2

---

## 📁 Part A  Theory (Short Questions)

### 1. Nine Pillars Understanding

**Q1: Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for me growth as a system architect?**  
A : Using AI for repetitive tasks (like setting up folders, configs, or tests) **saves time and reduces manual work**. This allows me to **focus on designing systems, planning architecture, and thinking strategically**, which helps me grow as a system architect.

**Q2: How do the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer?**  
A : The Nine Pillars cover all the key areas of AI-driven development. By mastering them, a developer can **gain deep expertise in 2–4 areas while being competent in others**, creating a **broad and deep skill set** the M-Shaped Developer.

### 2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development

**Q1: Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?**  
A : Vibe Coding is fast and unstructured. Without clear specifications, code often becomes **messy, hard to maintain, and full of hidden bugs** as the project grows.

**Q2: How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?**  
A : Specification-Driven Development begins with **clear requirements and system design**. This ensures the project stays **organized, maintainable, scalable**, and reduces errors over time.

### 3. Architecture Thinking

**Q1: How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?**  
A : Instead of just writing code line by line, developers **plan systems, guide AI tools, and make strategic decisions**. Coding becomes a smaller part of the role, while **designing and orchestrating the system takes priority**.

**Q2: Why must developers think in layers and systems instead of raw code?**  
A : Thinking in layers ensures the system is organized, scalable, and easy to maintain. Just coding line by line can create messy software.

2. **What is the biggest mindset shift in AI-Driven Development?**  
 
- B. **Thinking in systems and giving clear instructions**   
 

3. **Biggest failure of Vibe Coding?**  

- B. **Architecture becomes hard to extend**   


4. **Main advantage of using AI CLI agents (like Gemini CLI)?**  
  
- B. **Handle repetitive tasks so dev can focus on design & problem-solving**  
 

5. **What defines an M-Shaped Developer?**  

- C. **Deep skills in multiple related domains**

## 🌟 Reflection

AI-driven development is changing the way developers work. With the **Nine Pillars, Specification-Driven Development, and AI agents**, coding is no longer just typing it’s about:  
- **Thinking strategically**  
- **Planning systems**  
- **Building scalable architecture**  

The goal is to grow into an **M-Shaped Developer**, gaining deep expertise in multiple areas while letting AI handle repetitive tasks.
